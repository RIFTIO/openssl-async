=head1 NAME

SSL_waiting_for_async, SSL_get_async_wait_fd - manage asynchronous operations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_waiting_for_async(SSL *s);
 OSSL_ASYNC_FD SSL_get_async_wait_fd(SSL *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_waiting_for_async() determines whether an SSL connection is currently
waiting for asynchronous operations to complete (see the SSL_MODE_ASYNC mode in
L<SSL_CTX_set_mode(3)>).

SSL_get_async_wait_fd() returns a file descriptor which can be used in a call to
select() or poll() to determine whether the current asynchronous operation has
completed or not. A completed operation will result in data appearing as
"read ready" on the file descriptor (no actual data should be read from the
file descriptor). This function should only be called if the SSL object is
currently waiting for asynchronous work to complete (i.e. SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC
has been received - see L<SSL_get_error(3)>).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_waiting_for_async() will return 1 if the current SSL operation is waiting
for an async operation to complete and 0 otherwise.

SSL_get_async_wait_fd() will return a file descriptor that can be used in a call
to select() or poll() to wait for asynchronous work to complete, or
OSSL_BAD_ASYNC_FD on error.

=head1 HISTORY

SSL_waiting_for_async() and SSL_get_async_wait_fd() were first added to
OpenSSL 1.1.0
