 * @description
 *     This function will open the config file at the supplied path.
 *     Parse the config file for the specified section and then parse
 *     for the specified key name. If the key name is found then the
 *     function will return 1 and copy the associated key value into
 *     the string supplied as the keyValue parameter. If the key
 *     name is not found then the function will return 0 and the
 *     keyValue string will not be populated.
 * @param[in] filename - a string containing the path and filename of
 *                       the config file to parse.
 * @param[in] sectionName - a string containing the section name to
 *                          match.
 * @param[in] keyName - a string containing the key name we are
 *                      trying to match.
 * @param[in, out] keyValue - This parameter should be passed in as
 *                            an allocated string. If a match is found
 *                            for the sectionName and keyName then the
 *                            key value associated with the key name
 *                            will be copied into this string.
 * @param[in] keyValueSize - the size of the allocated string passed
 *                           in as keyValue. This allows size checking
 *                           so we don't try and copy a key value that
 *                           is too large into the keyValue string.
 * @retval int - Return 2 if a key value was found.
 *               Return 1 if the section was found
 *               Return 0 if the key value nor section was not found or any errors occured.
